#Feature: tagging and replying

#  @wip
#  Scenario: User tags a mail, replies to it then checks that mail is in the right tag
#    Given I have a mail in my inbox
#    When I open the first mail in the 'inbox'
#    When I add the tag 'website' to that mail
#    Then I see that mail under the 'website' tag
#    And I open the mail I previously tagged
#    And I reply to it
#    When I select the tag 'sent'
#    Then I see the mail I sent
