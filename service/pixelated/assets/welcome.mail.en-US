Welcome to Pixelated Mail, modern email with encryption.

Pixelated Mail is an open source project that aims to provide secure email in the browser, with all the functionality we've come to expect of modern email clients.

How to use it
-------------

Pixelated Mail does what you've come to expect of your email program. On the left, you will find a navigation bar where you can find your mailboxes and tags. Clicking them will load the corresponding messages in the middle area - the mail list. Clicking on a message will show it on the right side, but you know it already!

To compose a message look for the big blue button on the top left. You can add tags to received messages by clicking on the "+" sign below the message subject. You can also find the encryption status of a message just above the sender/recipient information.

A bit more about Pixelated
--------------------------

Pixelated is an open source project licensed under AGPL 3.0. It is composed of 2 main parts, the User Agent (that you are using right now) and the Provider (which will send and receive your emails, the server behind the @ sign on your new mail address). You can learn more by visiting https://pixelated-project.org/.

About this message and encryption status
----------------------------------------

This message was not encrypted. Like any email, it could have been read by others before reaching your provider.
To send encrypted messages you have to have the public keys of the recipients. In Pixelated there are 2 ways to get someone's public key:
- when you send an email to another account on your provider, the public keys are exchanged by default
- when you receive an encrypted mail from anyone, their public key will be automatically stored


Enjoy your secure messaging!
