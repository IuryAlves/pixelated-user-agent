Pixelated User Agent
====================

This contains the Pixelated User Agent, which is composed of a web UI written as a JavaScript single page app, and a service that provides a REST-ful interface that the UI can use for all User Agent actions. For now, all of these actions are mail-related but this might evolve later. The default service is written to talk to a Pixelated or LEAP provider.
